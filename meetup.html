                I forgot to put some information here. I think this is a good stopping point for May 4th, 2020 for thr meetup page to start with.
                We need to start earlier tomorrow and get more practice.

                This Meetup was about a new startup organization created by web developers in the process of being freelancers and getting your name known.

                The second part of the Meetup is about how freelancers start their business. What business practices to govern yourself with and how to grow
                your freelance name and your enterprise by k nowing your pricing. Knowing what your skills are and how to sell yourself to your client directly.

            <!--CONTENT 4-->
            <div class="content4" id="main">
                We will also cover some ideas to do when raising your rates for your business and how to gauge what you are able to do. Then dissect those into
                how to sell your work. Do you work hourly for someone or do you sell packages that you offer to people. After everything is said and done, how
                do you know if you have enough in your personal web portfolio to get someone to notice you.
