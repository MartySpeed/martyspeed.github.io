                <h2>There are elements of setting up CSS grids that are still confusing to me. I am not sure what to set the values to and I am not sure If I am doing it correctly until I aam evaluated. I don't copy other peoples videos with the guides (<em>even then, they still dont get it right or the video is really old</em>), and the visual aids provded in class help, but there are still things in CSS that are unclear to me. I know that I need to ask for help, but for but I do now know the right questions to ask to even get started. Just saying I do not know is not good enough. There has to be some reasoning what it is that I do not know and a way for me to articulate where and how I am lost.</h2>
                
                <h2>This was a fun exercise in learning CSS grids, I look forward to setting some time to play with flexbox during everything that is going on in the world right now. This really let me know how much further that I have to go in learning in HTML5 &amp; CSS3 addition to getting things done amidst all the chaos in this world right now. I am happy that I have to capabilites to program and code to become something in a time where things could disappear completely.</h2>
