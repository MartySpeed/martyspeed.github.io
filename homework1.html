                    1. the link for the meetup page needs to be ready to work as the meetup report will have the same due dates as the final project<br>
                    2. the assignments page, and the contacts page will need to have the same menu and layout of the first page.<br>
                    3. you will need to create a favicon to include in your page, to be your logo.<br>
                    4. if your use the techniques of RWD (responsive web design) to create a mobile version for your site: homework1, assignments, and contacts need to be
                        responsive. the page should shown in a single column having the heading at the top, then the items of the menu (one item below the other), then 
                        the content, and finally the footer at the bottom. It will be okay not to have  the meetup page in RWD<br>
                    5. the layout of the front page needs to be using flexbox or CSS grid<br>
                    6. the layout (position of the elements) should be something as (the colors for the background are your choice and the CONTENT represents everything
                        you added to the homework1 html that was not the heading, links and menu.<br>
                    7. you will add a contact page, where you will have a paragraph saying that whoever wants to contact you can use the information in the footer part of
                        the page or they can fill out the form. the form you will build needs to have a field for a full name, another field for email address, and a text
                        area for comments. the name and email are required. remember to adjust the link of the homework 1 html page to that of the new contact html page.
                    8. in the footer area you will put some copyright information with your name and email address with a link that is related to the email.<br>

                    Hello, I am John Anthony and this is my webpage that I will continue to be upgrading throughout this class and for my portfolio work. 
                    I did not get the RWD or Responsive Web Design down to view this on mobile. I didnt quite undertand it to get it functioning properly. 
                    With that being said, I have accomplished a lot of the challenges that were given in the class and played alot with web design in my free 
                    time to learn new ways to craft a website and more. I have used CSS grids on this webpage to showcase my layout. I have used several of the 
                    grid as children and parents of elements in my html. The main content page is where I have a list of everything that needed to be done for 
                    my assignments. I have the main page itself in a grid and I have placed a child (the content) to also be in a grid style as well to make my 
                    layout more unique and to test the skill an different operations for my web page and applying the skills I have to different areas of my 
                    webpage that I have not tried before.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    I have also added a favicon to the website that I learned to create. This was more chellenging than I thought. I did not have photoshop
                    or any other phot editing software. I was told about to GIMP in order to make my own favicon, but the time in between learning new information
                    for HTML and learning CSS, it was time that I did not think that I had in order to come up with something. Even if there are websites that can
                    do it for me. I wanted to create something of my own. I used to Google Draw to create my logo and favicon for my webpage. The emblem is S.A.M.E.
                    This stands for Serious About My Enjoyment! To show how hard I work to enjoy the things that I love to do. Coding, playing video games, and more.

                    I have started a little out of order to do the excitement of how far I have come in the midst of this pandemic and keeping up with school and the
                    sudden new way of life. But I digress, Starting with the web page. I have changed the title of my html document page to reflect the Final Project
                    int he tab. After the title information for the webpage, I have the menu now in the right side next to the title using the css grid columns to
                    align them on the webpage. I ave added fonts from Google to give my content some of its oen personality. I also gave my paragprahs and content some
                    background and changed the font color to create a contrast. I wanted to do something that was dark and easy on the eyes. So I would like to design 
                    more website sin mind or people with delicate eyes, even though dark mode is starting to become more of normal in most websites and applications 
                    today.

                    The contacts page has been added along witht he footer int he bottom of the page. In the original this was for link that hosted useful websites 
                    that we used to help us. Since this I can make my own links and alter their appearance. The footer has my copyright information with my email in 
                    addition to a link to the contact page. The Meetup page has been added as well to what I participated an learned. You can learn more about what I 
                    discovered by clicking on the link the menu above.
