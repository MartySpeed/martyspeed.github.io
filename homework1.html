        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>
            My name is John Anthony. I am a Computer Science Major with an interest in front-end development,<br>
            back-end development, network engineering and cyber-security. I am still deiciding if I should follow<br>
            one path or all of them. I am an Air Force Veteren, I was an aircraft mechanic or heavy aircraft and<br>
            tanker aircraft. I like to code and make mods and game in my free time and that is how I got to the<br>
            door step of Web development and more. I enjoy coding, not just games, but websites, raspberry pi &amp;<br>
            Python automation trial and error and more. It is noth fun and challenging to have endless possibilities<br>
            that can be built in HTML and more.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I am still figuring out my path in web development. Through the many classes that I have started in this<br>
            field. I am starting to play more in HTML and web development. I am not sure what allis behind this field<br>
            yet, but I am dedicating time to figure that out. I enjoy making my own websites, an recreating some<br>
            features in other websites to use in my own test to create something new. Playing with the many different<br>
            features of HTML. I look forward to learning more throughout this course.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            One of my favorite websites is <a href="https://deadcells.com/" target="_blank" rel=" noopener noreferrer">Dead Cells</a>. I like this site because it is one of my favorite games to play,<br>
            aside from that, the visual layout of their website is amazing to me. It has the style that I like with the video<br> at the center of the home page. Placing their GIF's and video clips in a neat order fits my own style for<br>
            building a web portfolio for showing off your work and personal projects. The coloring in the background<br> of the webpage to match their aesthetic as well as how quick you can access all information for the site. It<br>
            definitely falls under the hierarchal design for being too shallow, but it<br> fits the growth of the game since it was released in 2018.
        </p>

            The <a href="http://www.ccsf.edu/en/student-services/student-counseling.html#wrap-subcontent" target="_blank" rel=" noopener noreferrer">Student Counseling</a> services offered at CCSF have helped me with classes that I should be considering<br>
            or taking for my career path. They assist in my career development with subjects or practices that best suit<br> me, as well as helping through any hardships that I may be going through. I have been helped by the CCSF<br>
            counseling in the metaphyscial &amp; physical areas in life. Driving, setting up schedules and one-on-one sit<br> downs with intructors. To the day to day toll that some students go through to help them stay on track when<br>
            everything else becomes a distraction.
